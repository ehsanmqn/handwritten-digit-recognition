# HANDWRITTEN DIGITS RECOGNITION :

## History of MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset :
Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database (MNIST dataset) is a large dataset of handwritten digits which is widely used in image processing and machine learning. The set of images in the MNIST database is a combination of two of NIST's databases: Special Database 1 and Special Database 3. Special Database 1 and Special Database 3 consist of digits written by high school students and employees of the United States Census Bureau, respectively.

## Why to start with MNIST ?
The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset for image classification. Tensorflow and Keras also provide MNIST dataset directly through their APIs. For the learning purpose, the MNIST dataset is easy to use and experiment with different machine learning techniques.

## Dataset description :
MNIST dataset has the following features :
   - Dataset size 60,000 samples of handwritten images.
   - The size of each image is 28x28 pixels.
   - Each image has only 1 color channel, i.e., grayscale image.
   - Each pixel has value in the range of [0,255] where 0 represents black, and 255 represents white.
   - Each image has labeled from 0-9.
